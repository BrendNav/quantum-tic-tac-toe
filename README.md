# Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¬

This is a personal project to simulate a quantum version of Tic-Tac-Toe â€” combining classical game logic with concepts like quantum superposition and entanglement.

## Features
- Classical and quantum move modes
- Simulated quantum behavior (not actual quantum hardware yet)
- Practice with game dev, frontend, and quantum-inspired logic

## Technologies
- Python / JavaScript (TBD)
- React (for frontend)
- Qiskit or simulated logic (for quantum behavior)

## Getting Started
More instructions coming soon...
